   ## Challenges
   During the project, writing the test cases using cy was challenging at the beginning.However at the end of the project, I got a pretty good handle on the test cases using Cypress

   ## Tests
   Ensure that both the component and e2e testing passes

   ## Future Implementation
   Add additional cypress tests for both component and e2e
